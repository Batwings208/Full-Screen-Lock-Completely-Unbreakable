# FullScreenLock
This program will allow you to get stuck in fullscreen forever

However this program is breakable by pressing the 'Begin' button but u can delete it later.
Also when you do 'Command+Q' the program will break so I added a little code which is commented out.
Do not run the commented code if u don't have another way as your battery will have to die first as it deactivates your entire keyboard and power button but for this program I have designed it in a way that when you click the button it will kill the program and activate your keyboard.

Use Carefully, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS
I HOLD NO LIABLITY IF YOU MESS UP YOUR COMPUTER OR YOU USE IT TO DO HARM

Have a great day!
